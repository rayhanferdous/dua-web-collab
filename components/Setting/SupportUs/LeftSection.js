          We have plans for many more useful Islamic apps and websites. So if you want all these projects to continue and reach millions of brothers
          and sisters with the message of Islam, then support us as much as possible every month or once.

          Even $10 dollar per month will take the project a long way, InshaAllah. If you help in this work, it will be added to your account of
          akhirah as a sadaqa zaria, In sha Allah, the stream of rewards will continue even after your death In sha Allah.
